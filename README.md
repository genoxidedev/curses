# curses
A small ASCII curses game I am programming for fun and also for learning C.
The game is written in C using the ncurses library.
The game is written on cygwin and compiled by gcc

# Compilation
I personally used a basic <code>gcc -o curses curses.c -lncurses</code>
which currently works well enough
