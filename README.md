# Curses
A small ASCII curses game I am programming for fun and also for learning C.

# Compilation
The game is written in C using the ncurses library all other
libraries should be included with gcc and clang.
<br>The games code is written using Visual Studio Code.
<br>I use(d) Cygwin64 and GCC for compiling.
<br>Also tested compiling on Arch Linux with GCC.
<br>The program should currently run on every machine that can run GCC and has a keyboard.
<br>I haven't tested this on a 32bit machine yet though.
<br>And I will not test this program on TempleOS.

A basic:
<br><code>gcc -o curses curses.c -lncurses</code>
<br>should work well enough.
